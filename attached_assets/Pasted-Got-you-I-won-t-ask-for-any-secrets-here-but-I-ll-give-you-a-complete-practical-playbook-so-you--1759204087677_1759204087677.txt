Got you — I won’t ask for any secrets here, but I’ll give you a complete, practical playbook so you can gather every piece of “auto-Twitter” (X) account information you might need for audits, backups, automation, or migration. Follow the steps below and you’ll have a secure, well-organized record of each account and app.

⸻

Quick safety rules before you begin

• Never paste API keys / OAuth secrets into public chat, repos or issues.
• Use a password manager (1Password/Bitwarden) or secret store (GitHub Secrets) to store tokens.
• If you suspect a token was exposed, rotate/revoke it immediately.
• Enable 2FA on all accounts.

1) What “auto Twitter account information” means (the full inventory)

Collect the following for every account / bot / integration:

Account-level info
	•	Twitter/X handle and user id (e.g., @yourhandle, numeric id)
	•	Email and phone registered
	•	2FA status & backup codes (store safely)
	•	Account role/permissions (who has access)

App / developer credentials (per app)
	•	App name / purpose
	•	Consumer Key (API Key)
	•	Consumer Secret (API Secret) — treat as sensitive
	•	Bearer token (for app-only v2 access)
	•	Access Token & Access Token Secret (user auth)
	•	OAuth 2.0 Client ID & Client Secret (if using OAuth2)
	•	OAuth redirect URLs registered
	•	Environment (dev / prod)
	•	Scopes/permissions (write, read, DM, etc.)
	•	Rate limits assigned

OAuth sessions / tokens
	•	Active access tokens (who/when issued)
	•	Refresh tokens (if OAuth2)
	•	Token expiry & refresh schedule
	•	Which access tokens map to which account (bot vs human)

Automation metadata
	•	Cron / scheduler entries (times / scripts)
	•	GitHub Actions / CI workflow names & secret names
	•	Replit / Heroku / Render env var names
	•	Server/process names and locations

Tracking & analytics
	•	Analytics credentials (if separate)
	•	Webhooks URLs and subscription status

Backups & archives
	•	Data requested (tweet archive / media)
	•	Archive timestamp & download location
	•	Exported followers/following CSVs

Security & ops
	•	List of IPs allowed (if app uses IP whitelisting)
	•	API usage logs (rate hits, errors)
	•	Incident history (suspensions, API blocks)

A. Account handle, id, email, phone, 2FA
